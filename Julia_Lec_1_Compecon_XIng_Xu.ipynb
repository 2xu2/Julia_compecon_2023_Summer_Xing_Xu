    "## Overview\n",
    "The purpose of the class is to get you familiarize with some basic dynamic programming (DP) problems in economics and train you to be comfortable with coding them in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why DP?\n",
    "\n",
    " Dynamic programming is the key to solving modern economic models. Most macro models now are dynamic general equilibrium models. Knowing how to solve recursive models is in additional useful for searching, matching and even game theory (with sequential games). \n",
    "\n",
    " ### Why Julia? \n",
    "\n",
    " Julia is the most modern tool for computations. It preserves the efficiency and clarity of coding while providing astounding speed. For comparison, c++ and Fortran are as fast but coding in them requires a lot more work as basically everything has to be built from scratch. Another extreme is Stata, which is super easy to code in (say, reg y x), but is absurdly slow and extremely limited in its applications (can't even perform DP). \n",
    " \n",
    " Julia reaches a great balance and is perfectly suited for computational economics. You will see its beauty in action once you get comfortable with it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Working with packages is of vital importance in Julia. We use \"LinearAlgebra\" for matrix operations, \"Statistics\" for different distributions, \"Plots\" for, obviously, plots, etc. One thing you always need to keep in mind is how to download some packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the essential packages you need, you have developed something called an \"environment\". For compatibility, version control and reproducibility reasons, one often wants to create individual environments for different files. \"Projects\" manages each individual local environments. It will create a project repository that usually contains a \"Project.toml\", a \"Manifest.toml\" and your code files.\n",
