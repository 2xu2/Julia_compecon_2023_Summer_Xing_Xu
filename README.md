# Julia_compecon_2023_Summer_Xing_Xu
## Overview
 This is the Github repository for the computational economics class in Summer 2023 by Xing Xu. The goal is to get you familiarized with some basic dynamic programming (DP) problems in economics and train you to be comfortable with coding them in Julia. 

## Set up of the Julia environment

Please follow the procedures from [Quantecon](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/getting_started.html#) to set up your Julia environment. Their lectures are great references although some of them might seem a little hard at the moment. Don't worry. Towards the end of the lecture, you will have enough tools for further learning by yourself.


## Syllabus

There are 5 lectures in total, with assignments accompanied. You can either download all the lectures or fork the repo. The first lecture sets the grounds and the following four lectures focus on different applications. I try to make the topics diverse enough so that they can be helpful for whatever field you are interested in.

* Lecture 1: [Julia Fundamentals](Julia_Lec_1_Compecon_Xing_Xu.ipynb)

* Problem set 1: [PS1](Julia_PS_1_Compecon_Xing_Xu.ipynb)

* Lecture 2: [A canonical Neo-classical growth model and glimpse into value function iteration (VFI)](Julia_Lec_2_Compecon_Xing_Xu.ipynb)

* Lecture 3: McCall's Job search model

* Lecture 4: Aiyagari with transition dynamics

* Lecture 5: Firm dynamics with an example of exporter dynamics
