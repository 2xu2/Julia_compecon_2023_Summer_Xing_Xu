    "### 1 What is firm dynamics?\n",
    "\n",
    "The firm dynamics literature wants to study firms' behavior over time. Dynamic models were developed to study firms' entry and exit decisions, age, size distribution over time and even R\\& D, export and FDI decisions, etc. More recently, spatial components are incorporated to study, say, firms' heterogeneous location choices for their subsidiaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "To dig into the literature, a good starting point is [Hopenhayn (1992)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951541), which provides a general theoretical framework that features uncertainty towards future profits, costly market entry and endogenous exit. The literature then expands dramatically with various focuses. Just to list a few, [Klette and Kortum](https://web.stanford.edu/~klenow/Klette%20and%20Kortum.pdf) on innovations and firm distribution, [Cooley and Quadrini (2001)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.5.1286) on financial frictions, [Das et al. (2007)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4502011) on exporter dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What's specific about exporter dynamics?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world where large multinationals take up a huge chunk of global economy via exports, the roles these giants play is a very interesting research topic. The OECD estimated in 2018 that multinational corporations account for half of global exports, nearly a third of world GDP (28%), and about a fourth of global employment. They hold great market power and sometimes even directly alter domestic and foreign policies. Understanding their growth and policy implications is a fascinating ongoing topic, which requires a lot of the tools discussed here. We can use the dynamic trade framework to study firms' individual and aggregate behavior, international policies and their implications on consumer welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remaining part of this section, I will discuss some empirical evidence about firm-level exporting behavior. I mainly follow from the literature review on [firm dynamics and trade](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27934/w27934.pdf) by George, Costas and Kim, ARE 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Firm-level facts (from firm-level data of US and Columbia):\n",
    "\n",
    "Static or time-invariant facts:\n",
    "* There are few exporters.\n",
    "* Exports are a small share of an exporter's total sales.\n",
    "* Exporters are relatively large firms. \n",
    "\n",
    "These facts can already trigger our thinking about the underlying firm distribution in size and productivity. These are consistent with the results of [Melitz (2003)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1555536). Within a group of firms originally producing domestically, only the most productive firms enter the export market. They stay in the market and force the less productive firms to exit. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we further take a look at the dynamic aspect of the data, there are some more interesting observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Past export participation is the main predictor of current export participation.\n",
    "* Exporter are less likely to exit if they are older and larger exporters in the past.\n",
    "* Entry rate is increasing in size and past export activity.\n",
    "* The longer an exporter stays in the market, the more it tends to export.\n",
    "\n",
    "These can explain why the dynamic aspect is vital to studying the exporting firms' behavior. I will show some predictions of the results when we go to the theoretical framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also evidences about heterogeneity between exporters on their export destinations, shipment volumes and frequencies and inventories. \n",
    "\n",
    "At last, The long-run response of aggregate trade volumes to changes in trade policy is larger than the short-run response. An important reason, as shown in [Kehoe and Ruhl (2013)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/670272), is that the aggregate trade growth is stronger in the long term due to the extensive margin. That is, during a trade liberalization, previously non-traded products grow faster than products that have already been traded between the same country pairs. One take-away is that larger quantities of firms (for concreteness, plants) would become exporters when there are ease in bilateral trade policies. Combining with the fact that exporters take time to grow, this gives a possible explanation for the long-run growth of trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Some questions to think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "On building a model, what structures do we need on individual firm's problem to retrieve the same results as we observe? For example, how to make sure that only a few firms enter into the export market and coincidentally they are relatively large? What about on the market structure and the demand side? \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can think about idiosyncratic and aggregate uncertainties. Idiosyncratic shock is convenient to generate endogenous entry and exit, as in the firm dynamics literature. Now we can look at if there are any heterogeneous short and long run responses to aggregate uncertainties, say real exchange rate fluctuations. If so, what are the policy implications?\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important topic in the trade literature is the gains from trade. That is the welfare gain of household in a country facing some sort of trade liberalization. Although the focus of our model is mainly on the firm side, we can still analyze the aggregate impact under a general equilibrium framework. \n"

    "The model is a slightly tweaked version of [Das et al. (2007)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4502011), based upon [Melitz (2003)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1555536).

    "\n",
    "This section is arranged as follows. I will first lay out the static model and provide analytical solutions to it. Next, I will provide the dynamic setup of the model and compute the model. To look at the firms' short-term reaction to some sudden and unexpected (MIT) shocks, I will then illustrate the algorithms for obtaining the transition dynamics. In the end, I will provide some basic calibration and some preliminary results. I run some experiments and look at the exporters' full dynamics facing different shocks.\n",

    "#### 5.2 Firm's Dynamic problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We first introduce an export fixed cost structure as in [Ruhl and Willis (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/iere.12232). The plant faces a sunk entry cost $f_E$ and a continuation cost $f_C$, $f_C \\leq f_E$. All export decisions are made at the end of previous period and fixed costs are paid upon decision. The exporting cost of each period can be expressed as:\n",

The nonexporter can deterministically lower its fixed cost next period to $\\xi_E$ by paying $f_E$. If a current exporter pays $f_C$ to continue exporting next period, it draws iceberg cost $\\xi_j \\in \\{\\xi_E, \\xi_C\\}$ next period from a Markov chain as in table \\ref{table1}.

    "Recall that the reason we use discrete approximations of value functions is that the computer can't process continuos variables. Same logic applies with an AR(1) process. We want to approximate the AR(1) process with a discrete markov chain, which is characterized by discrete states and a transition probability matrix. Check [Quantecon's lecture notes](https://julia.quantecon.org/introduction_dynamics/finite_markov.html) for a detailed explanation.\n",
